#DataScienceModels

Using datasets from Kaggle, I have created the following models:
1. Ocean temperature vs Salinity (Downloaded data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohier/calcofi)
2. Surviving the Titanic (Downloaded data from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv)
